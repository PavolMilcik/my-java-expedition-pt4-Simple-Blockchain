# Part 4 - Simple Blockchain :hotsprings:
My simple **Blockchain** in OOP in Java. First time using **Maven** as the **build system**.

## I have created a simple blockchain with the following properties:
- The blockchain is made up of blocks, each containing one transaction.
- Each block has a digital signature/hash that allows us to "chain" the blocks together.
- Creating a new block requires a "proof of work," which is provided by a miner.
- We can test the blockchain to ensure its data has not been altered and is therefore valid.
